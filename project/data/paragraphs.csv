113,for many nations particularly in the global south brics functions as a significant platform to voice their historical grievances and concerns that have often been overlooked by developed countries for russia china and iran this is a growing global forum where they can challenge the us and its allies and discuss ways to forge a global geopolitical alternative to the us led order even though both russia and china are key members of that order by virtue of being members of the un security council
114,for new and aspiring members brics represents a promise of future geopolitical influence no one wants to be left behind as discussions about shaping the new world order gain momentum but even as brics is faced with several major challenges it is seeking to enlist more members believing that expanding its membership will enhance its influence and transform it into a more pivotal global forum but the more it expands the more we are likely to witness glaring internal contradictions
115,there is less unity and more differences among brics members on various issues even when they agree to long summit declarations in a sense member countries sign on summit declarations rich in rhetoric because they are likely aware of their limited impact at the core of the challenges facing brics is that what primarily unites its member countries is not themselves but a shared opposition to the us led world order which they believe fails to address the needs of much of humanity
116,yet there is little consensus among the members regarding the extent and nature of their opposition to the us led order for example india and russia often hold sharply divergent views on how to reform the existing system or how to construct a new one reflecting their differing strategic interests and their respective relationship with the us and the west can the brics as a grouping emerge as a credible global geopolitical alternative the answer in my opinion is a resounding no if so should india geopolitical hitch its wagon to brics i would say no
117,international politics is not black and white surely there are lots of shades of grey therefore there is value in being part of forums like brics primarily for the purpose of geopolitical hedging for new delhi brics is a significant non western platform where some of the most influential alternative sentiments on the global order currently find voice even if much of this remains at the level of rhetoric for india the brics rhetoric serves as a valuable tool to enhance its leverage in other forums like the g7 and g20 as a bridge state
118,more so since brics consistently echoes concerns important to the global south it holds a great deal of instrumental value for new delhi as it seeks to position itself as a leading voice within the global south if you are not part of forums that focus on the concerns of the global south you may lack the legitimacy or platform to effectively represent or speak for its interests and yet such symbolic value could become counterproductive if it leads to or becomes entrenched in more sharply divided geopolitical positions

169,for russia china and iran this is a growing global forum where they can challenge the us and its allies and discuss ways to forge a global geopolitical alternative to the us led order even though both russia and china are key members of that order by virtue of being members of the un security council  for new and aspiring members brics represents a promise of future geopolitical influence no one wants to be left behind as discussions about shaping the new world order gain momentum
170,but even as brics is faced with several major challenges it is seeking to enlist more members believing that expanding its membership will enhance its influence and transform it into a more pivotal global forum but the more it expands the more we are likely to witness glaring internal contradictions there is less unity and more differences among brics members on various issues even when they agree to long summit declarations in a sense member countries sign on summit declarations rich in rhetoric because they are likely aware of their limited impact
171,at the core of the challenges facing brics is that what primarily unites its member countries is not themselves but a shared opposition to the us led world order which they believe fails to address the needs of much of humanity yet there is little consensus among the members regarding the extent and nature of their opposition to the us led order
172,for example india and russia often hold sharply divergent views on how to reform the existing system or how to construct a new one reflecting their differing strategic interests and their respective relationship with the us and the west can the brics as a grouping emerge as a credible global geopolitical alternative the answer in my opinion is a resounding no if so should india geopolitical hitch its wagon to brics i would say no international politics is not black and white surely there are lots of shades of grey
173,therefore there is value in being part of forums like brics primarily for the purpose of geopolitical hedging for new delhi brics is a significant non western platform where some of the most influential alternative sentiments on the global order currently find voice even if much of this remains at the level of rhetoric for india the brics rhetoric serves as a valuable tool to enhance its leverage in other forums like the g7 and g20 as a bridge state

175,for instance the anti west rhetoric is a good starting point for india to get more receptivity and attention from the west brics offers its member countries different value propositions for many nations particularly in the global south brics functions as a significant platform to voice their historical grievances and concerns that have often been overlooked by developed countries
